====

- setting a hold while in QuickSave just pushes the hold on top of the QuickSave, so that when
  the hold is resumed, we're back to the QuickSave.  Verify with logging, but if so, need to
  have "Home" action repeatedly pop events off the stack until the quickSave is popped off.
  Also, calculating isAway() must change to account for quickSave being somewhere in the stack.
  Think about this.
- Obscure app_key so no one can pirate it
- Enable/disable Resume button based on presence of resume-able events.
- Find out if HaDevice "Commands" is usable while the device is up and running

Testing
=======
- It's not the "ems" account type to be concerned with, it's the actual model of the thermostat! (Right?)
- Catch when getting tokens fails because the PIN expired, so we can get a new PIN.


Enhancements
============

- Add `UniqueAccount` to ecobee device variables.  Defaults to `0`, meaning that this instance of the
  ecobee device will try to use another shared instance's `auth_token` if available, instead of requesting
  a new `auth_token`.  If there are no other `UniqueAccount=0` instances, this instance will make a PIN
  request.  Whichever account grants this PIN request will invalidate any previous grants.  If
  `UniqueAccount` is set to `1`, it means that this instance of the ecobee device will *not* pull some other
  instance's `auth_token`, nor share its own auth_token with other instances.  This will allow a mix of 
  shared and private `auth_token`s across multiple instances of the ecobee device.
